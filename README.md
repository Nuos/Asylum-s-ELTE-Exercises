# ELTE Asylum Exercises

This project contains the solutions of the exercises I presented in my courses at ELTE (see http://m.cdn.blog.hu/da/darthasylum/tutorials/elte.html)

## Compilation

You need *Visual Studio 2015* or newer to compile the samples. You also have to create a substitute T: drive like

```
subst t: path_to_OGLPack
```

This will be automatically removed when you restart Windows.
